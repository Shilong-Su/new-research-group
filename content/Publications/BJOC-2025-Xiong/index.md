abstract: The polycyclic skeleton of tris(4,5-dehydro-2,3:6,7-dibenzotropone) is a key structural fragment in carbon schwarzites, a theoretical form of negatively curved carbon allotrope. This report presents a new synthesis of this compound using a Ni-mediated Yamamoto coupling reaction and structural analysis of it with X-ray crystallography. Interestingly, it is observed that tris(4,5-dehydro-2,3:6,7-dibenzotropone) crystallized from its solution in hexane resulting in colorless and yellow crystal polymorphs, where it adopts conformations of approximate Cs and C2 symmetry, respectively. Furthermore, expanding its π-skeleton through the Barton–Kellogg and Scholl reactions led to the successful synthesis of a curved polycyclic arene containing three heptagons and two pentagons.
